# About me

I am a phonetician and phonologist currently serving as as a Visiting Assistant Professor in [Linguistics at Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/linguistics/), teaching courses in Phonology and general Linguistics. Prior to this, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in English Language & Linguistics at Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany ([English](https://www.anglistik3.hhu.de/en/), [German](https://www.anglistik3.hhu.de/)), as part of the [Speech, Language, and Modeling Lab](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/). 

I completed my Ph.D. at Yale University’s [Department of Linguistics](https://ling.yale.edu/) and its Phonetics Laboratory, with a dissertation on the role of tone in articulatory timing in Tibetan as spoken in diaspora. I am interested in the temporal representation of articulatory gestures, and more generally the relationships between tones and segments, language contact, sound change, and anything related to Tibetan.

To these ends, I have used a variety of methods, including field interviews, corpus methods, acoustic phonetics, and experiments with Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA). More recently, I have been working with articulatory synthesis in TADA and VocalTractLab, and have been collaborating on language-modeling projects involving probabilistic reduction.

Teaching is just as important to me as research. It is a great joy, and a great challenge. I approach teaching as a skill that requires continual development like any other, and I am a member of the Special Interest Group in Scholarly Teaching of the Linguistic Society of America.
