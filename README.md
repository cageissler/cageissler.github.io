## Welcome!


I am a phonetician and phonologist currently serving as a postdoctoral researcher in English Language & Linguistics at Heinrich-Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany ([English](https://www.anglistik3.hhu.de/en/), [German](https://www.anglistik3.hhu.de/)), as part of the [Speech, Language, and Modeling Lab](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/). I completed my Ph.D. at Yale University’s [Department of Linguistics](https://ling.yale.edu/) and its Phonetics Laboratory, with a dissertation on the role of tone in articulatory timing in Tibetan as spoken in diaspora. My research primarily concerns the representation of speech sounds in terms of the temporal representation of gestures, and more generally the relationships between tones and segments, language contact, sound change, and anything related to Tibetan.

To these ends, I have used a variety of methods, including field interviews, corpus methods, acoustic phonetics, and, in particular, Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA).

Teaching is just as important to me as research. It is a great joy, and a great challenge. I approach teaching as a skill that requires continual development like any other, and I am a member of the Special Interest Group in Scholarly Teaching of the Linguistic Society of America.
