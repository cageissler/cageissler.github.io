### How to read

More specifically, how to read the "lab report" style of scientific writing that is popular in linguistics.

- [My quickstart guide](https://cageissler.github.io/files/How_to_read/How_to_read.pdf) to how to read a linguistics article (especially in phonetics)
- [Annotated short article](https://cageissler.github.io/files/How_to_read/Hashimoto_2019_exemplars_annotated.pdf) illustrating the above procedure
- [Sample one-page handout](https://cageissler.github.io/files/How_to_read/Handout_Hashimoto_2019.pdf) of the same article (Just one example! There are many ways to make a handout)

This lesson was inspired by [this blog post about reading books](https://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/permanent-features-advice-on-academia/how-to-read-in-college/) by Tim Burke, a professor of history at Swarthmore College. I recommend that for advice on reading books in social sciences and humanities.


### E-learning Review Units in Phonetics and Phonology

Funded by an E-Learning Foerderfonds grant from HHU, Lara Rueter and Julika Weber developed a series of self-paced review units under the supervision of Kevin Tang and myself. Check them out [on our OSF page](https://osf.io/kjnad/) or ORCA.nrw.
