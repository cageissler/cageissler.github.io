# Recipes

## Vegan Chinese cooking

I am a huge fan of Hannah Che's blog, [*The Plant-Based Wok*](https://theplantbasedwok.com/), and her cookbook, [*The Vegan Chinese Kitchen*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-vegan-chinese-kitchen-recipes-and-modern-stories-from-a-thousand-year-old-tradition-a-cookbook-hannah-che/17789024?ean=9780593139707). Particular favorites:

- [Pressed Tofu Salad](https://omnivorescookbook.com/sliced-tofu-salad/): it's in the book but not on the website; this link describes something similar. Che's version uses more cilantro!
- [Scallion Pancakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aAd37lWeBc): Che's YouTube channel has just one video, and it's one of the best videos on the platform. These things are extraordinary.


## Desserts

- [Chickpea Balls/Besan Laddoo](https://veganlovlie.com/vegan-besan-ladoo-chickpea-flour-fudge-balls/): typically these are made with ghee (clarified butter), but it's possible to substitute coconut oil... if you're careful. Veganized Laddoo seem to require (1) adding a splash of water right when you take it off the heat; (2) powdered sugar, not anything else; (3) waiting until the mixture is cool enough to handle before adding the sugar. Follow the linked recipe exactly.
- [Pumpkin cookies](https://lovingitvegan.com/vegan-pumpkin-oatmeal-cookies/)
- [Emergency peanut cookies](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/peanut-butter-cookies): 1 cup sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, 1 egg. 350F/180C for ~10 minutes. Good vegan egg-replacers sort of work.
